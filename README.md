# ML-Education-Summer2025


## Introduction 

According to the popular book "Outliers" by Malcolm Gladwell, mastery in any endeavor takes around 10000 hours. If you study 2 hours a day every day, every week for almost 14 years, you'll reach this point. As one can see, quite a bit of dedication and sacrifice is needed to reach there. Is this point arbitrary? Maybe, maybe not. People cite studies and all, but the reality is:

**Mastery in anything is a subjective thing, and it totally depends**

However, even Andrej Karpathy enchoes this sentiment. He says, "just do the hard work". And Michael Jordan says the same thing. So who am I argue against it?

This summer, I am looking to rack up around 1000 hours. Instead of 2, I have 8 hours a day, minimum. So let's see where this goes!

The basic gameplan will evolve with time, but it'll be written below!

## Gameplan

1. Hands on machine learning by Aurelien Geron

### Courses
